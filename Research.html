<u><b><h1>REFLECTION OF MIRROR:</h1></b></u>    
<P>Have you ever thought about why we can see our image in a plane mirror? Itâ€™s because of the phenomenon known as reflection. Light waves, sound waves, and water waves can undergo reflection. In this session, let us learn about the reflection of light and the types of reflection in detail.</P>
<U><H2>What Are the Laws of Reflection?</H2></U>
<P>The laws of reflection are divided into two main points and they are:</P>
<ul>
    <li>The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.</li>
    <li>The incident ray, reflected ray, and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.</li>
    </ul>
